Engineer weighed in on India coach Ravi Shastri copping criticism, along with captain Virat Kohli for risking themselves by attending the former India all-rounder's book launch. Shastri's upcoming book is titled 'Stargazing: The Players in My Life', and its launch was August 31, two days before the start of the 4th Test, which Kohli was also part of. And just five days later, Shastri tested positive for Covid. The blame game shifted automatically towards Shastri but Engineer feels pointing fingers at the head coach or captain is unfair.
